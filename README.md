### Blockchain Vanity


An easy way to tell people on how to send cryptocurrencies to you. Instead of sending an QR code or copy/pasting your address to the person wanting to send cryptocurrencies to you. You can say send money to "ArkDevelopmentFund".

You can always change your address whenever you want without of having to notify your sender.
